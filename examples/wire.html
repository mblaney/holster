    <h2>Holster.wire - test examples</h2>
    <p>
      This file loads <code>wire.js</code> which contains examples that use the
      Holster.wire API. These examples show how conflict resolution works, see
      the console log for test output.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tests also make two updates in random order, but the wire API can
      set state vectors on updates to control which value should be applied.
      This means when the "species" field is logged it will always be the same
      no matter which order the tests run in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>wire.js</code> file is loaded as a module, which allows it to
      import the development build of Holster. You can switch to the production
      build by changing the import path at the top of the file.
