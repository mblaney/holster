    <h2>Holster.user - test examples</h2>
    <p>
      This file loads <code>user.js</code> which contains examples that test the
      Holster.user API. See the console log for test output.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tests create two users, Alice and Bob. They both write data to their
      own user space. Bob writes secret data that can only be read by Alice,
      then Alice logs in again to read the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tests also show how to use the SEA API (Security, Encryption, and
      Authorization), which can be loaded on it's own, but it made available via
      holster.SEA. The holster.user API uses the SEA API internally for creating
      and authenticating users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>user.js</code> file is loaded as a module, which allows it to
      import the development build of Holster. You can switch to the production
      build by changing the import path at the top of the file.
